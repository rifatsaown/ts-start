## TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and can be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution.

## Installation
To install TypeScript, you need to have Node.js installed. You can install TypeScript using npm, the Node.js package manager. Open a terminal window and run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Usage
To compile a TypeScript file, use the `tsc` command followed by the name of the TypeScript file. For example, to compile a file named `app.ts`, run the following command:
```bash
tsc app.ts
```
This will generate a JavaScript file named `app.js` that you can run using Node.js or in a browser.
